<td align="justify"><p class="starttd"><b>Q. What is a score?</b><br/>
 Broadly speaking a score is the result obtained by a player of your game. It can be a simple, single number, or something more complex with several different components.</p>
<p><b>Q. What are the different score components available to me?</b><br/>
 A Scoreloop score can have the following individual components:</p>
<ul>
<li>the score result, (the main result),</li>
<li>a minor result, (an optional secondary result),</li>
<li>the level, (the game-stage at which the score was achieved),</li>
<li>the mode, (the gameplay setting at which the score was achieved).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Q. What are the different score components used for?</b><br/>
 The result, minor result, and level can be used for score comparison purposes. The mode - which could refer to things like different difficulty or speed settings - is used in the generation of leaderboards, (Scoreloop generates separate leaderboards for each mode in a game).</p>
<p><b>Q. What is a mode?</b><br/>
 Modes are optional game properties that indicate the gameplay setting at which a score was obtained. Typical gameplay settings might refer to speed or difficulty. For example, a game may define three modes (0,1,2) corresponding to different gameplay settings ('slow', 'normal', 'fast'). A score obtained at the 'slow' mode would have the corresponding mode value of 0. Scoreloop generates separate leaderboards for each mode defined in the game, (i.e. a 'slow' leaderboard, and separate ones for 'normal', and 'fast').</p>
<p><b>Q. What is a level?</b><br/>
 A level refers to the game stage that a score was achieved at, (Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, etc). Modes are used in the generation of leaderboards, levels can be used for score comparison purposes.</p>
<p><b>Q. What exactly is a leaderboard?</b><br/>
 A leaderboard is a sorted list of the best scores submitted by users of your game. Scoreloop generates separate leaderboards for each mode defined in your game. In addition, Scoreloop can filter scores according to the following criteria producing separate leaderboards for each:</p>
<ul>
<li>Global Leaderboard, (all scores submitted by users of your game for a particular mode)</li>
<li>24 hours Leaderboard, (the best scores submitted in the previous 24 hours for a particular mode)</li>
<li>Friends Leaderboard, (the best scores submitted by friends of the session user)</li>
</ul>
<p>Other Leaderboards are available for developers using the CoreSocial SDK like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nationality leaderboard, (the best scores for a particular mode filtered by the nationality of the session user) and</li>
<li>Country leaderboard, (the best scores for a particular mode filtered according to the user's geographical location) <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For more details please look at the CoreSocial SDK documentation that is included in this download.</p>
<p><b>Q. Can I define my own score comparison schema?</b><br/>
 Yes. You can configure how scores in your game will be compared by visiting <a href="https://developer.scoreloop.com.">https://developer.scoreloop.com.</a> The result, minor result, and level can be configured according to what best suits your game. The default ordering used by Scoreloop is: </p>
<table class="doxtable">
<tr>
<td><div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"> result &gt; minor result&gt; level
</pre></div> </td></tr>
</table>
<p>You are free to change the ordering of this comparison on the developer website. You can also exclude up to two of the score components from the comparison schema, if you wish, as well as defining whether scores should be sorted in ascending or descending order.</p>
<p><b>Q. How does Scoreloop decide what the best scores are?</b><br/>
 You can choose whether scores should be sorted in ascending or descending order. To do this go to <a href="https://developer.scoreloop.com,">https://developer.scoreloop.com,</a> navigate to the 'Scores' page and choose whether the score result should be 'ascending' or 'descending'.</p>
<p><b>Q. Is there a limit to how many modes I can have in my game?</b><br/>
 The only limit imposed is the maximum value set for a <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html">java.lang.Integer</a> object.</p>
<p><b>Q. How do I configure modes in my game?</b><br/>
 If your game supports modes, please refer to the <a class="el" href="../../dd/d1a/scoreloopui-integratemodes.html">Supporting Multiple Modes</a> section for more information on how to integrate modes into your game.</p>
