# The game ID assigned to your game by Scoreloop (do not modify this)
game.id = f9fa2829-532c-4c71-856f-96b585a135db

# The name of your game (provided by you when registering your game)
game.name = SL Demo TNG

# The version of your game (game version should be 1.0 or above)
game.version = 1.0

# If your game supports multiple modes specify the minimum and maximum modes here.
# By default, every game has one mode. To add more modes, modify the game.mode.max.
# Note that the maximum is not inclusive, (i.e. min=0, max=3 defines modes 0, 1, and 2).

game.mode.min = 0
game.mode.max = 3

# In order to sort local scores, you have to provide a score comparator. 
# Possible values are ascending or descending (the default)
#game.score.comparator.result = ascending
#game.score.comparator.minorResult = ascending

# Your game-specific currency code (do not modify this)
currency.code = XPT

# The currency symbol as it will appear in the UI (you may modify this).
currency.symbol = C

# The singular and plural forms of your currency (you may modify these).
currency.name.singular = Lemon
currency.name.plural = Lemons

# ScoreloopUI properties -------------------------------------------------------
#

# Set this value to true to enable challenges when using ScoreloopUI. (default
# is false)

# (default is false)
ui.feature.achievement = true

# Set this value to true to enable the news feature when using ScoreloopUI. 
# (default is false)
ui.feature.news = true

# By default, ScoreloopUI enables access to the local device address book. This
# lets Scoreloop check for other Scoreloop users in your address book and  add 
# them to your buddy-list. If you wish to disable this feature, set this to false.
# If this feature is disabled, you may also remove the READ_CONTACTS permission
# from the AndroidManifest.xml
#ui.feature.address_book = false

# This is the specification of the score formatter. Consult the ScoreFormatter 
# documentation for details.
ui.format.score = mode:0=A;mode:1=B;mode:2=C;

# The following properties allow you to say what elements of a score should
# be output in the given screen. e.g. show score and level in the leaderboards
#ui.format.score.leaderboard = ScoreAndLevelFormat
#ui.format.score.challenges = LevelAndModeFormat
#ui.format.score.socialnetworkpost = DefaultFormat

# These properties are used to format how the balance of in-game currency appear
# in the UI.
# See http://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/Formatter.html for 
# more information about formatting conventions. 
#ui.format.money = %2$s(%1$.2f)

# Use this property to say if you want Scoreloop to synchronize achievements
# with the server before you can access them. Set to false if you want to make
# achievements without this initial synchronization. (default is true)
#ui.feature.achievement.forceSync = false
