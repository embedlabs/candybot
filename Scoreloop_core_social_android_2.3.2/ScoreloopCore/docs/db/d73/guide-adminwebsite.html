<h1>The Scoreloop Developer Website </h1>  </div>

<div class="contents">
<div class="textblock"><p>All games must be registered and properly configured on the Scoreloop Developer website. If you have not alread done so, please go to <a href="https://developer.scoreloop.com">https://developer.scoreloop.com</a> and create a developer account. Then you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>register your game and obtain application data for your game</li>
<li>configure your game properties</li>
<li>configure the scoring schema</li>
<li>configure awards</li>
<li>configure custom emails</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="registering-yourgame"></a>
Registering Your Game</h2>
<p>This is a necessary first step in using the CoreSocial SDK . By registering your game on the developer website, you receive two pieces of data unique to your game: a game identifier, and a game secret.</p>
<p>Both the game identifier and the secret are must be added to your game code. It is therefore important that you first register your game and obtain both before starting to implement CoreSocial.</p>
<p>The game identifier and the secret can be retrieved at any time by logging onto <a href="https://developer.scoreloop.com.">https://developer.scoreloop.com.</a> In addition, you should also download scoreloop.properties file from the developer website and add it to your assets folder.</p>
<p>Each game that you wish to integrate with CoreSocial must be registered separately. However, you need only create a single Scoreloop account from which you can have instant access to all of your registered games.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="configuringyourgame"></a>
Configuring Your Game Properties</h2>
<p>All registered games must contain (minimally) a name. You can also configure additional game properties including:</p>
<ul>
<li>a short description of your game</li>
<li>publisher's name</li>
<li>purchasing information</li>
<li>the current state of the game (e.g. "in development" or "live")</li>
</ul>
<p>The name and additional descriptive information you give your game can be changed subsequently through the edit capabilities of the Developer website. The game identifier and game secret that were generated by Scoreloop will, however, always remain the same.</p>
<p>The Scoreloop servers are automatically updated to reflect any changes or edits made by you through the developer website.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="configuringscoreschema"></a>
Configuring the Scoring Schema</h2>
<p>You may configure a schema on the Developer website which will be used by Scoreloop to compare scores that are submitted by users of your game. There are three properties which may be configured:</p>
<ul>
<li>Game result, (the primary game result obtained by users of your game)</li>
<li>Minor result, (an optional secondary result which may also be considered)</li>
<li>Level, (the game level at which the score was achieved, this is also optional)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can configure an arbitrary comparison order for these three properties, (e.g. first compare the game level, then the result, then the minor result). Up to two properties may be excluded from the schema, (at least one property must remain in order for the comparison to be valid). Each property can be configured so as to be sorted in ascending or descending order.</p>
<p>If you wish you may use Scoreloop's default comparison schema: </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
 result &gt; minorResult &gt; level.
 </pre></div><h2><a class="anchor" id="awards"></a>
Configuring Awards</h2>
<p>Your game might support awards which are target states in your game that can be achieved by the user. Achievments are awards unlocked during the gameplay. Developers must configure awards on the Scoreloop developer website. Once an award has been configured on the website, Scoreloop generates an awards bundle, which developers must add to their assets folder of the game project. The awards bundle provides local access to the individual award properties.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="custom_emails"></a>
Configuring Custom Emails</h2>
<p>You may configure custom emails on the developer website. Custom emails are triggered after certain challenge events, such as winning or losing a challenge, or when a challenge expires. You are free to customize these emails by providing two images for display in an email header. The main image will appear only once and will generally include the game name and game icon. The second image will repeat after the main image and should be configured if you wish your email header to have a “banner” effect. </p>
