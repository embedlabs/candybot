Want to get hands on?

The easiest way to experience the Scoreloop SDK is to run one of the two Demo applications on your device.

E.g. if you want to explore and run SLDemoUI, you should import the ScoreloopUI and SLDemoUI projects into your IDE.


Include Scoreloop into your own game

You can look at how things are set up for the demo applications and follow the approach with your game.
Generally, add the necessary scoreloop-core.jar file to your project, add ScoreloopUI as dependency and
download and add a scoreloop.properties file tailored to your game to the assets/ folder of your game.

To get a scoreloop.properties file, go to http://developer.scoreloop.com, create a game at our server
and download it under the Game Properties section.

Have a look at the Docs folder for more information on how to set up your game for Scoreloop integration.
