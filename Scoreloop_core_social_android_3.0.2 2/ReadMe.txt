Developers looking for a quick Scoreloop Integration should look into ScoreloopUI as ScoreloopUI comes with a ready-built user interface allowing game developers to add social features into their games quickly and easily.
For more information about using the ScoreloopUI, take a look at the following resources:
 
	- Documentation (API reference and integration guides)   
	  Open Docs/ScoreloopUI_doc.html 

	- SLDemoUI (Demo application showing integration of ScoreloopUI)	  
	  The easiest way to experience the ScoreloopUI is to run the SLDemoUI application on your device.
          E.g. if you want to explore and run SLDemoUI, you should import the ScoreloopUI and SLDemoUI projects into your IDE.

For developers who do not wish to use ScoreloopUI due to various reasons (such as customisations or wanting to use their own UI) can use the ScoreloopCore low-level APIs to integrate Scoreloop's features. Developers who do this will, however, have to build their own user interface. 
For more information about using the ScoreloopCore, take a look at the following resources:
