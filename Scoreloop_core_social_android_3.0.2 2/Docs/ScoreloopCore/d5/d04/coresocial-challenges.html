<div class="textblock"><p><b>Q. What is a challenge?</b><br/>
 A Scoreloop challenge is where 2 players compete against each other in order to get the best score and win a prize of in-game currency.</p>
<p><b>Q. Do they compete against each other in real time?</b><br/>
 No. In a challenge players do not compete against each other simultaneously. First one player plays the game, gets a score, and submits it to Scoreloop. Then the second player plays the game, gets a score, and submits it to Scoreloop. The player with the best score wins the challenge.</p>
<p><b>Q. How is the 'best' score determined?</b><br/>
 The best score is determined according to how you have configured scoring for your game on <a href="https://developer.scoreloop.com.">https://developer.scoreloop.com.</a></p>
<p><b>Q. What is meant by 'contender' and 'contestant'?</b><br/>
 These terms have very specific meanings for Scoreloop:</p>
<ul>
<li>The contender is the user who starts the challenge.</li>
<li>The contestant is the user who accepts the challenge.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Q. What is the challenge stake?</b><br/>
 The stake is the amount of in-game currency that both players must contribute in order to take part in the challenge.</p>
<p><b>Q. Who decides how big the stake should be?</b><br/>
 The contender (that is the player who starts the challenge) sets the size of the stake. The stake options available to the contender are dependent on their balance of in-game currency: the larger the balance, the larger the minimum stake will be. So, for example, a user with a balance of 10 units might be able to place a minimum stake of 1 unit, whereas for a user with a balanc of 100 unit the minimum stake might be 5 units. This calculation happens server-side.</p>
<p><b>Q. What are the steps involved in a Challenge Life Cycle?</b><br/>
</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The contender decides on a stake and creates a challenge. It is at this stage that they decide whether the challenge should be open or direct.</li>
<li>The contender plays the game and submits the challenge and the score they obtain to the Scoreloop server.</li>
<li>A second Scoreloop user, the contestant, accepts the challenge and pays the challenge stake. If the challenge is open it may be accepted by any Scoreloop user. If it is a direct challenge, only the user to whom the challenge was assigned by the contender may accept it.</li>
<li>The contestant plays the game and submits their score to Scoreloop.</li>
<li>Scoreloop compares the scores of the contender and the contestant in accordance with the game scoring schema as defined by the game developer and declares a winner.</li>
<li>The winner takes the challenge prize, (75% of the combined contender and contestant stakes).</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Q. What does the winner of the challenge get?</b><br/>
 The challenge winner gets the challenge 'prize', which is an amount of in-game currency. The challenge prize is calculated as being (1.5 x stake). The winner only receives the prize, (their stake is not returned to them as well). The following example makes this clear:</p>
<ul>
<li>Player's balance before challenge: 10 units</li>
<li>Challenge stake: 5 units</li>
<li>Player's balance after paying stake: 5 units, (i.e. 10 - 5)</li>
<li>Challenge prize: 1.5 x stake = 1.5 x 5 = 7.5 units</li>
<li>Player's balance after winning challenge: 12.5 units (= balance after paying stake + challenge prize)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Q. Are there different types of challenges?</b><br/>
 There are two types: 'open' and 'direct'. An open challenge is one that can be accepted by anyone. A direct challenge is one that has been assigned to a specific, named Scoreloop user. In a direct challenge only the user to whom the challenge has been assigned may accept it.</p>
<p><b>Q. Who decides whether a challenge is 'open' or 'direct'?</b><br/>
 The contender (the user who starts the challenge) decides whether it is open or direct.</p>
<p><b>Q. Does Scoreloop do anything to try to promote fairness in challenges?</b><br/>
 Yes. Scoreloop calculates a 'skill level' for each Scoreloop user. This skill level is dependent on how well a user has performed in past challenges, (how many they have won and lost). The skill level for a user will change over time. When a user requests a list of all open challenges, we only display open challenges from other users with a similar skill level. This is to ensure that new or weaker players aren't unfairly targeted by stronger or more experienced ones. </p>
