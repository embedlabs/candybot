<td align="justify"><p class="starttd"><b>Q. What is a challenge?</b><br/>
 A Scoreloop challenge is where 2 players compete against each other in order to get the best score and win a prize of in-game currency.</p>
<p><b>Q. Do they compete against each other in real time?</b><br/>
 No. In a challenge players do not compete against each other simultaneously. First one player plays the game, gets a score, and submits it to Scoreloop. Then the second player plays the game, gets a score, and submits it to Scoreloop. The player with the best score wins the challenge.</p>
<p><b>Q. How is the 'best' score determined?</b><br/>
 The best score is determined according to how you have configured scoring for your game on <a href="https://developer.scoreloop.com">https://developer.scoreloop.com</a> .</p>
<p><b>Q. What is meant by 'contender' and 'contestant'?</b><br/>
 These terms have very specific meanings for Scoreloop:</p>
<ul>
<li>The contender is the user who starts the challenge.</li>
<li>The contestant is the user who accepts the challenge.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Q. What is the challenge stake?</b><br/>
 The stake is the amount of in-game currency that both players must contribute in order to take part in the challenge.</p>
<p><b>Q. Who decides how big the stake should be?</b><br/>
 The contender (that is the player who starts the challenge) decides the size of the stake. The stake options available to the contender are dependent on their balance of in-game currency: the larger the balance, the larger the minimum stake will be. So, for example, a user with a balance of 10 units might be able to place a minimum stake of 1 unit, whereas for a user with a balanc of 100 unit the minimum stake might be 5 units. This calculation happens server-side.</p>
<p><b>Q. How much is the Challenge Prize ?</b><br/>
 The challenge winner gets the challenge 'prize', which is an amount of in-game currency. The challenge prize is calculated depending on the challenge sink that the developer has chosen to use. The challenge sink represents the cost of a challenge, and is calculated as a percentage of the total virtual currency pool of a challenge (the sum of the stakes contributed by each player).</p>
<p>For example: When 25% sink is in place: If both players contribute 5 coins to play a challenge, the winner is awarded 7.5 coins because 2.5 coins (10 - 25% = 2.5) are taken as the challenge cost. When no sink (0%) is in place: If both players contribute 5 coins to play a challenge, the winner is awarded 10 coins (10 - 0% = 10).</p>
<p>The following examples demonstrate the currency wallet during a challenge:</p>
<p>25% challenge sink</p>
<ul>
<li>Player’s balance before challenge: 10 units</li>
<li>Challenge stake: 5 units</li>
<li>Player’s balance after paying stake (10 - 5): 5 units,</li>
<li>Challenge prize: (100-25%) of (2 * stake) = 75% of (2 * 5) = 7.5 units</li>
<li>Player’s balance after winning challenge: (balance after paying stake + challenge prize) = (5 + 7.5) = 12.5 units</li>
</ul>
<p>0% challenge sink</p>
<ul>
<li>Player’s balance before challenge: 10 units</li>
<li>Challenge stake: 5 units</li>
<li>Player’s balance after paying stake (10 - 5): 5 units,</li>
<li>Challenge prize: (100-0%) of (2 * stake) = 100% of (2 * 5) = 10 units</li>
<li>Player’s balance after winning challenge: (balance after paying stake + challenge prize) = 15 units</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Q. What does the winner of the challenge get?</b><br/>
</p>
<p>The player who loses the challenge loses their stake outright. The winner of the challenge receives the challenge prize only, which does not include their stake.</p>
<p>The following example makes this clear:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>At the start of the challenge:<ul>
<li>Contender balance: 100 units</li>
<li>Contestant balance: 10 units</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The challenge stake is, say, 5 units.</li>
<li>Balances after paying the stake:<ul>
<li>Contender balance: 95 units</li>
<li>Contestant balance: 5 units</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The challenge prize: (25% sink) = (100-25%) of (2 * stake) = 75% of (2 * 5) = 7.5 units. (0% sink) = (100-0%) of (2 * stake) = 100% of (2 * 5) = 10 units</li>
<li>if contender == winner:<ul>
<li>(25% sink)<ul>
<li>Contender balance = (balance after paying stake) + (prize) = 95 + 7.5 = 102.5 units</li>
<li>Contender balance = balance after paying stake = 5 units</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(0% sink)<ul>
<li>Contender balance = (balance after paying stake) + (prize) = 95 + 10 = 105 units</li>
<li>Contestant balance = balance after paying stake = 5 units</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>if contestant == winner:<ul>
<li>(25% sink)<ul>
<li>Contender balance = (balance after paying stake) = 95</li>
<li>Contestant balance = (balance after paying stake) + (prize) = 5 + 7.5 = 12.5 units</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(0% sink)<ul>
<li>Contender balance = (balance after paying stake) = 95</li>
<li>Contestant balance = (balance after paying stake) + (prize) = 5 + 10 = 15 units</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Q. Are there different types of challenges?</b><br/>
 There are two types: 'open' and 'direct'. An open challenge is one that can be accepted by anyone. A direct challenge is one that has been assigned to a specific, named Scoreloop user. In a direct challenge only the user to whom the challenge has been assigned may accept it.</p>
<p><b> Q. Who decides whether a challenge is 'open' or 'direct'?</b><br/>
 The contender (the user who starts the challenge) decides whether it is to be open or direct.</p>
<p><b>Q. Does Scoreloop do anything to try to promote fairness in challenges?</b><br/>
 Yes. Scoreloop calculates a 'skill level' for each Scoreloop user. This skill level is dependent on how well a user has performed in past challenges, (how many they have won and lost). The skill level for a user will change over time. When a user requests a list of all open challenges, we only display open challenges from other users with a similar skill level. This is to ensure that new or weaker players aren't unfairly targeted by stronger or more experienced ones.</p>
<p class="endtd"><b>Q. How can I keep track of what challenges I have taken part in?</b><br/>
 The ScoreloopUI <a class="el" href="../../d1/d35/scoreloopui-integratechallenges.html">Challenges View</a> displays your challenge history, which is a record of challenges played, won, and lost by you. </p>
