		The Mobclix Android Library no longer requires the developer to manually handle AdMob Open Allocation.

		<b>Bug Fix: Fixed Android SDK 7 (2.1) ViewFlipper bug in Android SDK 8.</b><br>
		Android SDK 7 introduced a bug where a ViewFlipper would cause errors if the orientation of the phone changes back and forth rapidly. The fix implemented is detailed at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=6191">http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=6191</a>. The fix was extended to the recently released SDK version 8.
	</li>
    <li>
		<b>Bug Fix: Fixed bug with Android 1.5.</b><br>
		The ViewFlipper fix used an API 4 method, causing AdViews to run into issues on Android platforms 1.5 and earlier.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 2.0.3</h2>  

<ul type="circle">
    <li>
		<b>Feature: Added pause() and resume() methods.</b><br>
		Some developers hoping to pause ad requests while they ran heavy processing threads were using cancelAd() to stop ads. This is inelegant, so pause() and resume() were introduced to allow for cleaner pausing and resuming of ad requests.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>General: Improved location awareness of FINE and COARSE location permissions.</b><br>
		Improved the handling of location awareness. Notably, the SDK will only attempt to require a GPS position for ten seconds before succeeding or giving up. This will prevent the SDK from draining the battery unduly.

		Android SDK 7 introduced a bug where a ViewFlipper would cause errors if the orientation of the phone changes back and forth rapidly. The fix implemented is detailed at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=6191">http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=6191</a>.
	</li>
    <li>
		<b>Bug Fix: Fixed does not refresh setting bug.</b><br>

	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 2.0.2</h2>  

<ul type="circle">
    <li>
		<b>General: Increased performance on remote configuration retrieval.</b><br>
		Update to the polling thread that waits for remote configuration retrieval has been updated to be more efficient. Also improved remote configuration error handling when the device has no limited or no connection.
	</li>
    <li>
		<b>General: Improved text ad formatting.</b><br>
		Single line text ads are now vertically centered in the ad space. Originally, they appeared above or below another TextView that only contained an empty string.
	</li>
    <li>
		<b>Bug Fix: Fixed Mobclix Suballocation.</b><br>
		Suballocation requests were returning as -503 UNAVAILABLE errors instead of Suballocation for AdMob and Google AdSense.
	</li>
    <li>
		<b>Bug Fix: Better error handling when an ad is clicked.</b><br>
		If an <code>MobclixAdView</code> was instantiated with a non-Activity context, an exception would be thrown when the ad was clicked. This has been handled and should now direct the user to the url.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 2.0.1</h2>  

<ul type="circle">
    <li>
		<b>Bug Fix: Fixed a NullPointerException.</b><br>

		The Mobclix Android Library now has support for Mobclix's Rich Media ad formats, including text ads, banner ads, slider ads, video ads, and popover ads.
	</li>
    <li>
		<b>Feature: Remote Configuration support.</b><br>
		The Mobclix Android Library now has support for remote configuration of its ad units. From the dashboard, you can now set the refresh time for your Ad Units, which will be reflected every time the app relaunches.
	</li>
    
    <li>
		<b>General: Minimum refresh time set to 30 seconds.</b><br>
		Lower refresh rates decrease CTR and can strain the system.
	</li>
    <li>
		<b>General: AdViews retrieve ads automatically upon initialization.</b><br>
		AdViews no longer need to have <code>getAd()</code> called to retrieve ads. This means that no code at all is necessary to grab ads, only adding the AdView to the layout.
	</li>
    <li>
		<b>General: Method <code>public boolean shouldTouchThrough(MobclixAdView adview)</code> removed.</b><br>
		This method allowing the blocking of ad touch through has been removed.
	</li>
    <li>
		<b>General: Reduced delay on loading first Activity with a Mobclix AdView by 80%.</b><br>
		Better handling of retrieving phone settings has reduced the delay noticed by some developers when they first loaded an Activity with a Mobclix AdView.
	</li>
    
    <li>
		<b>Bug Fix: NullPointerException no longer thrown on <code>query</code> and <code>keywords</code> methods of <code>MobclixAdViewListener</code>.</b><br>
		When the <code>query</code> or <code>keywords</code> methods of the <code>MobclixAdViewListener</code> were set to return <code>null</code>, the Mobclix library would throw a NullPointerException.
	</li>
    <li>
		<b>Bug Fix: NullPointerException no longer thrown on initialization of a Mobclix AdView when the APPLICATION_ID isn't set in the AndroidManifest.</b><br>
		When the APPLICATION_ID wasn't set in the AndroidManifest, instantiating a Mobclix AdView was throwing a NullPointerException. This has been replaced with a NotFoundException with an error message to better indicate the problem.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Bug Fix: <code>MobclixAdViewListener</code> methods are now called in the UI Thread.</b><br>
        In previous versions of the library, the <code>MobclixAdViewListener</code> methods were called in a separate thread, preventing developers from using these methods to change the UI of their application with implementing their own handlers. This has been fixed to make it easier to use these methods, especially for handling Open Allocation.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 1.0.4</h2>  

<ul type="circle">
    <li>
		<b>Bug Fix: Fixed ad loading fail -503 on 3G.</b><br>

	<li>
		<b>General: Added support for high pixel density screens.</b><br>
		Ads now take the appropriate amount of space on high pixel density screens such as the Nexus One and Droid.
	</li>
    <li>
		<b>General: AdView backgrounds have been changed to transparent by default.</b><br>
