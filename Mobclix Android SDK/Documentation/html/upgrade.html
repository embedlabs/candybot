[<a href="./../index.html">Mobclix for Android</a>] >> Upgrade To Mobclix for Android 4.0.2 Guide<br>

<h1>New to Mobclix Android SDK 2.3</h1>
<h2>Full Screen Ad View</h2>
<p>
In Mobclix SDK 2.3, we have introduced the ability to display a fullscreen interstitial ad. It will
allow you to preload and display a fullscreen advertisement in your application. Please
see the quickstart guide and full SDK documentation to learn how to implement and use this new feature.
</p>

<h2>Rich Media and User Interaction</h2>
<p>
In Mobclix SDK 2.0 we introduced the ability to support autoplay interstitial ads, and we’ve 
taken it a step further in 2.2.  Included as apart of our additional rich media support is the 
ability for rich media ads to automatically access features of the phone that wouldn’t 
otherwise take them away from your app.  Some of these features include the vibrate 
functionality, audio support, and access to the LED light on supported Android devices.
We’ve added a new configurable setting called richMediaRequiresUserInteraction.  By 
default, this is turned off.  You can turn it on by either going to the developer dashboard or 
returning "true" for the new method setRichMediaRequiresUserInteraction of MobclixAdViews.
As with autoplay interstitial ads, you’ll see a much higher eCPM if you allow these kind of ads 
in your application.

Analytics for the Mobclix Android Library has been turned on. It is recommended to make a call to <code>Mobclix.onCreate(this);</code> at the entry point of your application. Once called, the Mobclix Android library will track your application's sessions. For more accurate results, it is recommended to make a <code>Mobclix.onCreate(this)</code> call at every Activity's <code>onCreate</code> method and to make a <code>Mobclix.onStop(this)</code> call at every Activity's <code>onStop</code> method.
